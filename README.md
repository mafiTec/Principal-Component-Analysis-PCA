#  Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA

Principal Component Analysis is a technique for Feature Extraction so it combines our input variables in a specific way, then, we can drop the “least important” variables while still retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables As an added benefit, each of the “new” variables after PCA are all independent of one another This is a benefit because the assumptions of a linear model require our independent variables to be independent of one another.
